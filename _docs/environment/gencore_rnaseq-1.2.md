## Software Packages

### bamtools
**Version:** 2.4.0

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
C++ API & command-line toolkit for working with BAM data



### bcftools
**Version:** 1.3.1

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.  Most commands accept VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype detected automatically even when streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF will work in all situations. Un-indexed VCF and BCF and streams will work in most, but not all situations.



### bedtools
**Version:** 2.25.0

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
A powerful toolset for genome arithmetic



### bioconductor-ballgown
**Version:** 2.2.0

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
Tools for statistical analysis of assembled transcriptomes, including flexible differential expression analysis, visualization of transcript structures, and matching of assembled transcripts to annotation.



### bioconductor-biovizbase
**Version:** 1.18.0

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
The biovizBase package is designed to provide a set of utilities, color schemes and conventions for genomic data. It serves as the base for various high-level packages for biological data visualization. This saves development effort and encourages consistency.



### bioconductor-cummerbund
**Version:** 2.16.0

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
Allows for persistent storage, access, exploration, and manipulation of Cufflinks high-throughput sequencing data.  In addition, provides numerous plotting functions for commonly used visualizations.



### bioconductor-deseq2>
**Version:** 1.12.4

**Conda Channel:** default

#### Summary:




### bioconductor-edger
**Version:** 3.14.0

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with biological replication. Implements a range of statistical methodology based on the negative binomial distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact tests, generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq, it be applied to differential signal analysis of other types of genomic data that produce counts, including ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, SAGE and CAGE.



### bioconductor-genomicranges
**Version:** 1.26.1

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
The ability to efficiently represent and manipulate genomic annotations and alignments is playing a central role when it comes to analyzing high-throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The GenomicRanges package defines general purpose containers for storing and manipulating genomic intervals and variables defined along a genome. More specialized containers for representing and manipulating short alignments against a reference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of an experiment, are defined in the GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages respectively. Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges infrastructure.



### bioconductor-gviz
**Version:** 1.16.5

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
Genomic data analyses requires integrated visualization of known genomic information and new experimental data.  Gviz uses the biomaRt and the rtracklayer packages to perform live annotation queries to Ensembl and UCSC and translates this to e.g. gene/transcript structures in viewports of the grid graphics package. This results in genomic information plotted together with your data.



### bioconductor-s4vectors
**Version:** 0.12.0

**Conda Channel:** bioconda

#### Summary:
The S4Vectors package defines the Vector and List virtual classes and a set of generic functions that extend the semantic of ordinary vectors and lists in R. Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-like objects as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a few low-level concrete subclasses of general interest (e.g. DataFrame, Rle, and Hits) are implemented in the S4Vectors package itself (many more are implemented in the IRanges package and in other Bioconductor infrastructure packages).
